        I'm a multimedia professional looking to make a career change into web/software development. I've spent the past 9 years working in television stations and recording studios creating professional quality media for thousands of people to consume. Now I want to combine that experience with a newfound passion for programming to create high quality products that can change people's lives. I have worked primarily in Python, including the Django web framework, and HTML/CSS, but I also have experience with JavaScript, Ruby and SQL, and am constantly learning something new. I am hungry, and eager to find a situation where I can continue to learn and contribute to a great company.

      Here are some examples of work I've done in the past.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
            is also notorious as the founder of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
            Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
            are slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
            his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
            Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
            heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
            bus as he is from his kitchen table.
